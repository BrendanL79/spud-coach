    Ships defaulting to "base" for everything. On DLC day, teach THIS ONE
    function the real signal, in priority order (see
    docs/dlc-incorporation-playbook.md):

      1. Extraction origin (most likely + cleanest): if the DLC ships as a
         separate .pck, unpack it into a marked tree and pass the origin in via
         `entry`; echo it here.
      2. In-.tres flag / unlock gate: a `dlc`/`unlock` field readable off
         `record`.
      3. Directory prefix: a DLC-specific path segment (e.g. "abyssal/") on the
         record's source paths.

    Until taught, every record is base-game content.
